1.Why did you need to write a remove method in the SudoKuIterator class even
  thought your program never actually needs to remove any cells from puzzle?

  In this project, SudokuIterator class implements Iterator interface and 
  Iterator has three methods, which is hasNext(), next(), and remove(). If this
  project does not use remove method, we still have to implement this remove
  method to be stub because of interface.

2.Look at the files in your project directory. Describe what is different about
  the .class for the SudokuIterator class.

  For this project, we implement an inner class, SudoKuIterator, at Sudoku 
  class. The file name for SudoKuIterator is Sudoku$SudokuIterator, which 
  describes that there is a subclass in this class. If a class does not include
  a subclass or inner class, the file name is only showing the class name, for
  example, Cell.class.

3.Explain how long it takes your isSolution method to run on different sized 
  puzzle in terms of Big-O notation. 
  
  In my program, it will take oder-N square to check whether the solution is 
  correct or not because there are two for loop for the method.
